# Email Spam Classification Using AI/ML

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or not spam. By leveraging modern AI techniques, this project demonstrates the use of supervised learning to detect spam emails with high accuracy.

## Key Features:
- **Email Preprocessing:** Cleans and preprocesses the email data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **Feature Extraction:** Converts email text into numerical representations using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
- **Model Training:** Trains a classification model using algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Logistic Regression.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Real-Time Classification:** Allows users to input email text and classify it as spam or not spam.

## How It Works:
1. **Data Collection:** The project uses publicly available datasets like the Enron email dataset or SMS Spam Collection dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Emails are cleaned by removing HTML tags, special characters, and unnecessary spaces.
   - Tokenization and lemmatization are applied to standardize the text.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Converts email text into numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for input to the machine learning model.
4. **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the chosen classification algorithm.
5. **Evaluation:** The model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its performance and tune hyperparameters for optimization.
6. **Deployment:** A simple user interface or API is created for real-time spam classification.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python:** The core programming language for data processing and machine learning.
- **Pandas/Numpy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **NLTK/Spacy:** For natural language processing tasks.
- **Flask/Streamlit (Optional):** To build a lightweight web interface for classification.

## Project Structure:
1. **Dataset:** Contains the spam and ham email data.
2. **Preprocessing Module:** Includes scripts for text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
3. **Model Training Module:** Includes scripts for training, testing, and saving the machine learning model.
4. **Deployment Module (Optional):** Scripts to deploy the model for real-time predictions.

## Screenshots:
1. **Spam Email Example:** Screenshot of spam email classification.
2. **Ham Email Example:** Screenshot of normal email classification.
3. **Performance Metrics:** Graphs and tables showing evaluation metrics like confusion matrix, precision, and recall.

## Future Enhancements:
- Implement deep learning models such as LSTMs or Transformers for better accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to include multilingual email data for broader applicability.
- Develop a browser extension for real-time email classification.
- Add email categorization (e.g., promotions, social, updates) alongside spam detection.

## Why This Project?
This project is ideal for:
- Learning how to apply AI/ML techniques to real-world problems.
- Understanding text classification and NLP techniques.
- Gaining experience in building end-to-end machine learning projects.
